# Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard

ðŸ“ˆ [**Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard**](https://kuljeet-123.github.io/covid-19/) shows the dynamics (the curvature of the graph) of Ð¡oronavirus distribution per country.

### Main Functionality

The dashboard is still raw but it provides a basic functionality of displaying the global and per-country data charts.

Here is how the main functionality looks like:

## Data source and tech-stack

The dashboard is using [COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) as a data source.

Front-end wise I've tried to make it as simple as possible, therefore the dashboard is using a pure [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (without `JSX` transpiler or `CreateReactApp` starter). To draw the chart I've used [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

## Terms of Use

This GitHub [repository](https://github.com/kuljeet-123/covod-19) and its [Dashboard](https://kuljeet-123.github.io/covid-19/) relies upon publicly available data from [COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) as its main data source.
